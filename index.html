        <h3> About Volleyball</h3>
        <p>Two teams play on a court divided by a net. The object of the game is for each team to send the ball over the net onto the oppenents ground, so basically its just a big game of don't let the ball touch the ground. To start the game the ball is served over the net from the opposing team behind thier backline.A player can not touch the ball twice in a row with the exception of when blocking. When the recieving team wins a rally it gains a point and everyone on that team moves once clockwise. When the ball goes out or touches the ground the point goes to the respective team, the first team to reach 25 wins the round if they are in lead by 2 if not the game continue until a team wins by 2. There is usually 3 or 5 rounds in a game. </p>
